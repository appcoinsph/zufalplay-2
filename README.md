# Zufalplay

A web interactive platform where users can play games, watch their favourite videos and write blogs to earn credit. This credit can either be used to take up mobile recharges or can be donated to the poor and needy.

Some unique features of <b>Zufalplay</b>:

<b><i>Play Games and Earn:</i></b>

Watch any <b>Youtube</b> video and earn.

The videos have also been <b>sorted by genre</b> to make it easy for users. One can also create a playlist which plays songs automatically in order (just like the Youtube Playlist) while crediting balance into your account for every song played.

<b><i>Write Blogs and Earn:</i></b>

As soon as you have published your blogpost, you will start earning, the money getting credited to your <b>Zufalplay</b> account. The amount you get per view depends on various factors such as how long the post is, where was it viewed from and how long was it viewed for.

<b><i>Redeem your Earnings by getting Mobile Recharges:</i></b>

The best part is the <b>Rs. 10</b> recharge. That's the quickest way to redeem your earnings!

<b>Rs. 50</b> and <b>Rs. 100</b> recharges are also available, depending on you account balance.

I would recommend you to try it out. I have already got plenty of recharges already!!

<b>**If your earnings reach a level in which it would be impractical to take up mobile recharges, you can request for cash payment which will be credited directly to your bank account.</b>

<b><i>Donate your Earnings to the Poor and Needy:</i></b>
